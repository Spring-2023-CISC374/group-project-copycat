# Copy Cat - Under Construction

This assignment is where you will submit your code for your MVP as well as the rest of the versions of your educational game.

This game is called Copy Cat. The goal is to have a better understanding of shallow vs deep copies. The game is a 2D platformer/puzzle game where players will have to copy and manipulate blocks to get the cat back home. Players will have to decide if they want to create a deep copy, where they can change the blocks individually, or a shallow copy where a change in one block changes the other. There are puzzles that require the player to change a block's size, color, and/or texture with challenges like rivers, distracting toys, and more!
