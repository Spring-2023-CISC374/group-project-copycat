# Copy Cat - Under Construction

This assignment is where you will submit your code for your MVP as well as the rest of the versions of your educational game.

The game we are proposing is called Copy Cat. The goal is to have a better understanding of shallow vs deep copies. The game will be a 2D platformer/puzzle game where players will have to copy and manipulate blocks to get the cat back home. Players will have to decide if they want to create a deep copy, where they can change the blocks individually, or a shallow copy where a change in one block changes the other. There will be puzzles that require the player to change a block's size, color, and/or texture with challenges like rivers, distracting toys, and more.
